3. **Financial System**  
   - Track income (ticket sales, cargo) vs. expenses (fuel, salaries, airport fees).  
   - Unlock better aircraft and airport hubs as you grow.  
4. **Event & Reputation System**  
   - Random events (economic booms, pandemics, etc.) that impact your finances.  
   - Reputation influences passenger demand and investor relations.  

**Unique Selling Points:**  
- **Dynamic Economy**: World events can drastically shift supply/demand.  
- **Depth with Accessibility**: A streamlined interface for complex decisions.  
- **Customization**: Livery, seating configuration, in-flight services.

- Casual to mid-core players who enjoy strategic planning.

**Development Scope & Goals:**  
- **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**: A functioning system to buy planes, set routes, and track basic finances.  
- **Future Features**: Employee management, marketing campaigns, alliances with other airlines.
